    <p style="padding-left: 500px; padding-right: 500px; padding-top: 100px;">Optics are everything we can see through the eye. Every colour, every flash of light, every sunset, and sun rise. 
      The eye is very complex. With so much complexity, comes errors, and failure. One of those errors being colour blindness. 
      People who are colour blind can have many different forms of blindness. There are multiple types including red-greed, 
      blue-yellow, and complete colour blindness. This causes people to see the world differently than how people without the defect can see. 
      They often mix the colours up, and cannot differentiate them. People can live their whole lives like this. Some researchers have developed 
      special glasses that can help individuals with this condition. One brand is EnChroma. They are known far and wide for their EnChroma collection 
      of colour blind glasses. </p>

      <p style="padding-left: 500px; padding-right: 500px; padding-top: 25px;">There are two types of colour blind glasses. Just like medicine, there are prescription glasses, 
        and non prescription glasses. Overlap is the reason for the issue with sight with colour. Per All About Vision, “color blind glasses contain proprietary optical materials
         that filter specific wavelengths of light where this overlap occurs.” Note, this does not cure it. This only helps while the glasses are being worn.
