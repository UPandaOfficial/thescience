      <p style="padding-left: 500px; padding-right: 500px; padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 50px;">Sir Frederick Grant Banting was his name, and diabetes was his game. Frederick Banting is one of three gentlemen who discovered insulin. Before insulin, it was a death sentence for people with diabetes. Banting wanted to change that. Frederick Banting was born on November 14th, 1891, in Alliston, Ontario, Canada. His parents were  William Thompson Banting, and Margaret Grant. Although he did not have diabetes himself, Banting was very interested in finding a cure, or even a treatment for diabetes. Banting had 4 other siblings, and he was the youngest of 5. He joined medical school in 1912, but in 1915 he successfully joined the army, and was a Captain in World War One.</p>

      <p style="padding-left: 500px; padding-right: 500px; padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 50px;">Mr. Banting got very interested in the disease known as diabetes. He had read articles, and this is what he got stuck on. He had tried multiple diffrent ways to create the hormone known as insulin. He had tried taking it from animals, and he was eventually successful. When insulin was first invented, it used animals, but now it is artificialy generated. The first patient was Leonard Thompson. He sold the patent to insulin for $1 so that insulin could be accessable to everyone. In 1923 Banting won a joint Nobel Peace Prize for his work with Insulin. His work and his perseverance with Insulin has saved millions of lives to this date. His work is tied heavily into biology due to the nature of Insulin, and how it works with the human pancrease, and interaction with other major organs. Insulin helps balance the blood sugar levels in the body, and is necessary to survive.</p>
